# Example of food catalog. Each record consists of four required attributes:
# number of calories, proteins, fats & carbs. All values must be set based on
# 100 grams.
#
# Also, you may set aliases for any item which you further will be able to use
# in the journal. For the instance down below, there is no difference between
# writing "sausage" or "sausages": second one has the same meaning.

# Below, there are normal entries with all the data needed:
#
sausage:
    calories:  113.8
    protein:   3.4
    fat:       0.4
    carbs:     23.7

apple:
    calories:  40
    protein:   0.4
    fat:       0.4
    carbs:     9.8

# You can make aliases to normal entries. Have a look:
#
sausages: sausage
apples: apple

# Aliases can link to other aliases, instead of normal entries. For instance:
#
sawsyges: sausages
applaz: apples
