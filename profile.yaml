# DAILY CALORIE INTAKE (AUTOMATICALLY CALCULATING VALUE)
#
# The calculation is based on Harris–Benedict equation. It is a well-known way to estimate
# an individual's basal metabolic rate (BMR).

# Activity multiplier.
# 
# Increases the daily calorie intake depending on your lifestyle. For example:
#
# - 1.2 (you don't go to the gym at all)
# - 1.375 (you go to the gym three times a week)
# - 1.55  (you go to the gym from three to five times a week)
# - 1.725 (wow, you go to the gym every day!)

activity_multiplier:  1.35

# Caloric deficit in percents.
#
# For instance, your daily calorie intake is 2500. However, you want to lose weight, so you decide to consume 25% less.
# In this case, you should set this option to 25: it makes the 625 calorie deficit you need, and your daily intake
# becomes equal to 1875.
